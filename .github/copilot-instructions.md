# Apache Flink Advanced Use Cases Project

This is an Apache Flink advanced stream processing project with Kafka integration. When working on this project:

## Context
- Use Apache Flink 1.18+ APIs and best practices
- Integrate with Apache Kafka for event streaming
- Implement real-time stream processing patterns
- Focus on windowing, state management, and complex event processing
- Use Java 17 features and modern programming patterns

## Key Technologies
- Apache Flink for stream processing
- Apache Kafka for event streaming and messaging
- Flink SQL for stream analytics
- Flink CEP for complex event processing
- Jackson for JSON serialization
- SLF4J + Logback for logging

## Patterns to Implement
- Stream transformations and aggregations
- Windowing functions (tumbling, sliding, session)
- Stateful stream processing
- Event time vs processing time
- Watermarks and late data handling
- Kafka source/sink connectors
- Complex event patterns
- Real-time analytics and dashboards

## Code Style
- Use descriptive variable and method names
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow Flink best practices for performance
- Use modern Java features (records, streams, optional)
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples
